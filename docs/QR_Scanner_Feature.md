# QR Scanner Feature for Customer Order Verification

## Overview

The QR Scanner feature allows customers to verify that delivered products match their orders by scanning QR codes on product labels. This enhances customer confidence and provides a way to confirm order accuracy.

## How It Works

### 1. QR Code Generation (Admin Side)
- When an order status is changed to "processing", QR codes are automatically generated for each product
- Each QR code contains a verification URL: `/orders/{order_id}/verify/{product_id}`
- QR codes are embedded in PDF labels that can be printed and attached to products

### 2. Customer Verification Process
- Customers can access the QR scanner from multiple entry points:
  - Order details page (for delivered orders)
  - Customer dashboard (quick action for delivered orders)
  - Orders index page (QR icon for delivered orders)

### 3. Scanning Process
- The scanner uses the device's camera to read QR codes
- Supports both mobile and desktop browsers with camera access
- Real-time scanning with visual feedback

### 4. Verification Results
- **Success**: Product is confirmed as part of the order
- **Error**: Invalid QR code, wrong order, or product not found
- **Warning**: Product already verified

## User Interface Components

### QRScanner Component
- **Location**: `resources/js/Components/QRScanner.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Camera initialization and management
  - QR code detection and decoding
  - Error handling for camera permissions
  - Mobile-friendly interface

### Scanner Page
- **Location**: `resources/js/Pages/Orders/Scanner.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Progress tracking (verified vs total products)
  - Product list with verification status
  - Modal feedback for scan results
  - Continuous scanning capability

## Access Points

### 1. Order Details Page
- "Verify Products" button appears for delivered orders
- Direct link to scanner page for that specific order

### 2. Customer Dashboard
- Quick action card appears when user has delivered orders
- Dropdown to select which delivered order to verify

### 3. Orders Index Page
- QR scanner icon in actions column for delivered orders
- Tooltip shows "Verify Products"

### 4. Enhanced Verification Page
- Improved design for individual product verification
- Links to scanner page for verifying additional products

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Routes
```php
// Customer scanner page
Route::get('/orders/{order}/scanner', [OrderController::class, 'scanner'])->name('orders.scanner');

// Existing verification route (for QR code links)
Route::get('/orders/{order}/verify/{product}', [ProductLabelController::class, 'verify'])->name('orders.verify');
```

### Frontend Dependencies
- `html5-qrcode`: QR code scanning library
- Camera API access for scanning functionality

### Security Features
- Order ownership verification (customers can only scan their own orders)
- Product validation (ensures scanned product belongs to the order)
- Status checking (only delivered orders can be scanned)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Customer receives delivered order** with QR-coded product labels
2. **Access scanner** via dashboard, order page, or orders list
3. **Grant camera permission** when prompted by browser
4. **Scan QR codes** on each product label
5. **View verification results** with success/error feedback
6. **Track progress** as products are verified
7. **Complete verification** when all products are scanned

## Mobile Optimization

- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized camera controls
- Large scan area for easy targeting

## Error Handling

- **Camera access denied**: Clear instructions to enable permissions
- **Invalid QR codes**: Helpful error messages
- **Network issues**: Graceful degradation
- **Wrong order**: Clear indication of mismatch

## Future Enhancements

- Batch verification for multiple products
- Verification history and timestamps
- Integration with customer feedback system
- Offline scanning capability
- Push notifications for verification reminders

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with camera API support
- HTTPS required for camera access
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
